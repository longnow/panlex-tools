This file maps from the SILDoulosIPA font, copyrighted by SIL in 1993, to Unicode. The font differs from the map in AMPHON-map.txt. The map is partly identical to and partly different from SIL-IPA-1990-map.txt. The map is partly identical to and partly different from that of SIL-IPA93-2001.txt, with the differences including 0067.

The SIL maps map from codepoints within the fonts to Unicode names. This file maps from Unicode codepoints, assuming the text file is Unicode-encoded, to Unicode codepoints.

No mapping file provided by SIL appears to duplicate this file. Searches through the entire collection found differences between this and all others.

In the Unicode column, some values are “+”-delimited pairs. These are based on the understanding that the glyphs in the font represent transitions between two tones. Those characters don’t exist in Unicode. They are recoded as a sequence of 2 characters that represent the starting and ending tones that we understand these glyphs represent a transition between. The SIL map SIL-IPA93-2001.txt indicates that all such transitions are between middle and extreme tones.
