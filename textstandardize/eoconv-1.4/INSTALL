SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

eoconv requires Perl 5.6 or higher.  It's been tested with Unix-like
systems, but will probably run on other platforms as well.


INSTALLATION
------------

1) If you are using a Unix-like system and have Perl installed
somewhere other than /usr/bin/perl, open the file eoconv.pl in an
editor and modify the first line as appropriate.

2) Copy the eoconv.pl file to somewhere in your path.  For example, on
a Unix-like system, you might log in as root and type the following:

   # cp eoconv.pl /usr/local/bin/eoconv

3) Documentation in various formats is available in the `doc'
subdirectory; you can install this where desired.  For example, on a
Unix-like system, the man page might be installed as root as follows:

   # cp doc/eoconv.1 /usr/local/man/man1


RUNNING
-------

The program should be invoked from the command line.  Brief help is
available with the --help command-line option; a detailed man page is
available with the --man command-line option.
